/* 
Climbing Stair case :
If n = 2, we can easily determine that there are two ways for us to take these two steps â€” we can go slow & steady and take one step at a time, or we can feel adventurous, skip a step, and take two steps.

Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
